`CICERO_URL_BASE`: defines the URL base for generated links in the Markdown file finder


## Template customization

It is possible to use your own template for customization and branding.  For
this place a file called "remark.html" in the same location as the Markdown
file which contains your slides. If such a file exists, it will be used instead
of the [default template](../master/cicero/templates/remark.html). Make sure to
use the variables "title" and "markdown" in your custom template. Apart from
that you have full liberty to employ own CSS and JavaScript.
